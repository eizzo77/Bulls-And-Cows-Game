First, you'll be asked to choose how many guesses you would like to have. the less guesses you have, the harder the game is. guesses range from 4 to 10.

1. at the top 4 black buttons are displayed, these represents the Computer Guess you have to decypher.
2. next to it, your guess buttons are shown, ready for you to click and pick your best guess. only your current guess line buttons are enabled. **Note: each color can be picked only once! there are no duplicates**

3. Once the line is full of colors, the Arrow Button is enable. After you're sure you have got the best guess you could think of - click on the Arrow Button to launch.
4. The 4 tiny squares at the end of each guess line demostrate how well your guess is
- Each **Black square** says a color in your guess is right on point! meaning the computer picked the same color in the same spot! (but you have to figure out which one it is)  
- Each **Yelow square** says you picked a color the computer picked, but the position is different.
- Each **Blank square** says you have not picked the correct color.
